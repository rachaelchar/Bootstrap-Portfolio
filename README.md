# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## 02_Week Assignment

This website is essentially another version of the first assignment I created for the UNH Bootcamp, which was the Basic-Portfolio. While that project used only HTML and CSS, this project is meant to serve the same purpose and look similar, but I built it using Bootstrap almost exclusively. The goal of this project was to make the pages responsive to smaller screen sizes.
